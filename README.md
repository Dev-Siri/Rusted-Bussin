# Rusted Bussin

The worst code I've written so far (in Rust btw). Check out the original [Bussin](https://github.com/face-hh/bussin) by [facedev](https://github.com/face-hh).

## Why?

Because we all know that Rust is the best language in the universe frfr no cap. And also because I like to suffer. This is only my like 3rd Rust project and I'm still figuring this language out so feel free to post this on r/badcode.

## Are there differences?

Yes, there's one. So you know how we can use our LOCAL currency for string interpolation in normal BSX? well in Rusted BSX, that doesn't exist because I lost my sanity trying to find a crate similar to `geoip-lite` and I don't want to anymore. Its already quite similar.

## How fast is it compared to TS?

I didn't run any benchmarks, but I'm sure you are not building the next GPT with `bruh` `syntax()`.
But I did compare the memory usage by the two versions. Here are the memory usages for the Repl:

| Language   | Memory Usage |
| ---------  | ------------ |
| TypeScript |   31.1MiB    |
| Rust       |   385KiB     |

## Getting Started

- clone
- compile
- run

I don't wanna write the same 3 things again :|
